# Project Overview

## Introduction

The intricate relationship between civil conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the distribution of emergency food aid is a multifaceted and interconnected matter. This assignment seeks to delve into this complex interplay. SSA, characterised by its diverse geography and intricate socio-political dynamics, consistently witnesses a recurring cycle of civil conflicts, each with its distinct triggers and consequences. Frequently, these conflicts are underpinned by common factors such as grievances, wealth and resource disparities, and food insecurity. Notably, food scarcity emerges as a prominent contributing factor, exacerbating conditions conducive to conflict and posing significant challenges for conflict resolution and post-conflict recovery.

Within this multifaceted context, emergency food aid serves a multifunctional role and is utilised by various stakeholders, including governments, rebel groups and international organisations. It functions as a tool for conflict prevention, management or even exploitation. This project aims to elucidate the nuanced and occasionally intricate interactions between emergency food aid and civil conflict in SSA. Utilising data spanning an 18-year period from 2002 to 2020, this project will employ various visualisation techniques to generate meaningful insights, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between conflict and food aid in the SSA region.

## Data
The dataset analysed in this project covers countries located in the SSA region over an 18-year period from 2002 to 2020. It includes data from a total of 54 countries within the SSA region encompassing a wide range of variables related to civil conflicts, natural disasters, economic indicators and political circumstances. The table below outlines the variables of dataset followed by a brief description of the data.

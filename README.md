# Project Overview

## Introduction
The objective of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis to determine countries' groupings based on COVID-19 level risk through the use of the K-means clustering method. The study will demonstrate the use of proprietary software tools such as IBM SPSS Modeller, JMP Statistical Software and MS Excel to accurately group countries based on their risk level by employing the most effective clustering strategies using two distinct time periods and selecting the most suitable variables. Guided by the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, the study aims to derive valuable insights through techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering modelling for country grouping based on their COVID-19 risk levels.
